The idea is to stick this on a (mostly) server that is in another room so you
can, say, have some control over MPD while you're cooking.

INSTALL

  1. Fiddle with the keybindings.

  2. Copy mptty to /usr/bin.

  3. Add a 'music' user for extra securtiy.

  3. Add the following to /etc/inittab:
     1:23:respawn:/bin/su music -c 'exec /usr/bin/mptty' 38400 tty1

  4. ...?

  5. Profit!
